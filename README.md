# DIC_HW2_Comparison-of-Logics-Family
Create circuits of CMOS, PTL, and Dynamic, three logic families for each gate and utilize it to build a 4-bit adder

EX2_1 is the verilog code for 4-bit adder
EX2_2 After synthesis the 4-bit adder, we get its gate level circuit. 
EX2_3 Shorten the critical path by using the gate which is contructed by different logic family and analyze its trade-off. (power, delay, ...)
